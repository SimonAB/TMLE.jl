# Resources

Targeted Learning is a difficult topic, while it is not strictly necessary to understand the details to use this package it can certainly help. Here is an incomplete list of external ressources that I found useful in my personnal search for enlightenment.

## Websites

These are two very clear introductions to causal inference and semi-parametric estimation:

- [Introduction to Modern Causal Inference](https://alejandroschuler.github.io/mci/) (Alejandro Schuler, Mark J. van der Laan).
- [A Ride in Targeted Learning Territory](https://achambaz.github.io/tlride/) (David Benkeser, Antoine Chambaz).

## Text Books

- [Targeted Learning](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-9782-1) (Mark J. van der Laan, Sherri Rose).

## Journal articles

- [Semiparametric doubly robust targeted double machine learning: a review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.06469) (Edward H. Kennedy).
